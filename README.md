This project is a code-along based on the DjangoCon talk by William Vincent: [YouTube Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLvovUVlhw).
The project uses Django to deploy a simple classifier machine learning model using the Iris dataset to predict the species given the petal and sepal lengths and widths.
